# Beach, please

Inspiration

When we picture ourselves at the seaside on vacation, we imagine a clean sea-shore with clear water. But in reality, it is never the case because marine pollution has become one of the biggest concerns of humankind at present. Thanks to the negligence of our fellow human beings, most beaches of Earth are littered with plastic, and non-biodegradable trash, which eventually reaches the sea/ocean water and adversely affects the marine ecosystem as well. This inspired us to build something that can help in restoring the beaches to their original clean and beautiful form.
